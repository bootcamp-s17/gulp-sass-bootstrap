<h1>Bootstrap...now, with SASS!</h1>

<p>I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone.</p>

<p>Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! I'll alert the crew. This should be interesting. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! Computer, belay that order. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. What? We're not at all alike! You enjoyed that. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister.</p>
